## Advent of Code 2023

## RUNNING:

All the puzzles can be run sequentially by:

```
python3 runner.py
```

It's also possible to run each puzzle individually by passing the `--day`
argument, and you can also run either part 1 or part 2 by passing `--part`.
There are more options, such as `--example` and `--input`:

```
$ python3 runner.py --help
usage: runner [-h] [--day DAY [DAY ...]] [--part PART] [--example] [--input INPUT]

runs the puzzles

options:
  -h, --help           show this help message and exit
  --day DAY [DAY ...]  the day to run
  --part PART          the part to run
  --example            use example input
  --input INPUT        input file to use
```
